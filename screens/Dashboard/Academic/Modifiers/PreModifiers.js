          <Text style={styles.text}>But noun phrases can also include:</Text>

            <Text style={styles.text}>•	Determiners:   Those houses are very expensive.</Text>
            <Text style={styles.text}>• Quantifiers:   I've lived in a lot of houses.</Text>
            <Text style={styles.text}>•	Numbers:        My brother owns two houses.</Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
        These parts of the noun phrase are called premodifiers because they go before the noun.

        <Text style={styles.text}>
        We use premodifiers in this order:

        </Text>

        For example:

        <Text style={styles.text}>
       Determiners and quantifiers	Numbers	Adjectives	NOUNS
The	six	 	children
Our	 	Young	children
 	Six	Young	children

Some	 	Young	children

    <Text style={styles.text}>2. We ate some bread and butter.</Text>

  <Text style={styles.sideHeading}>Some and any:</Text>

  <Text style={styles.text}>2. Did you see any friends?</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>3. We don't have any children.</Text>

    <Text style={styles.text}>
    We put a noun directly after a quantifier when we are talking about members of a group in general:

  <Text style={styles.text}>
1. Few snakes are dangerous.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>2. Most children like chocolate.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>3. I never have enough money.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>But if we are talking about members of a specific group, we use of the as well:</Text>

  
  <Text style={styles.text}>1. Few of the snakes in this zoo are dangerous.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>2. Most of the boys at my school play football.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>3. He’s spent all (of) the money that we gave him.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>4. Both (of) the chairs in my office are broken.</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>Note: with all and both, we don’t need to use of. We can say all the … and both the …. Both, either and neither</Text>
  
  <Text style={styles.text}>If we are talking about two people or things, we use the quantifiers both, either and neither:</Text>
<Text style={styles.text}>
One supermarket	Two supermarkets	More than two supermarkets
The supermarket
was closed.	Both the supermarkets
were closed.	All the supermarkets
were closed.
The supermarket
wasn’t open.	Neither of the supermarkets
was open.	None of the supermarkets
were open.
I don’t think the supermarket
was open.	I don’t think either of the supermarkets
was open.	I don’t think any of the supermarkets
were open.

<Text style={styles.text}>Note that nouns with both have a plural verb but nouns with either and neither have a singular verb.</Text>

  <Text style={styles.sideHeading}>Every and each:</Text>
  <Text style={styles.text}>We use the quantifiers every and each with singular nouns to mean all:</Text>

  <Text style={styles.text}>4. There was a prize in each competition. (= There were prizes in all the competitions.)</Text>

  <Text style={styles.text}>7. When we stayed at my grandmother's house, we went to the beach every day.</Text>

<Text> “A Gerund is that form of the verb which ends in “ing” and has the force of a Noun and a Verb.” (Wren and Martin)
</Text>
<Text>
It would appear from the above definition that a Gerund is formed by adding ‘ing’ to a Verb, and it performs the functions of both Noun and Verb. The sign of recognizing a Gerund is that it is always a ‘Verb + ing’, as—running , walking, driving, reading, writing, etc.

</Text>
<Text>
Note—It may be remembered in this connection that in form the Present Participle is also Verb + ing. But the functions of Gerund and Present Participle are quite different.

</Text>

<Text>
The function of Gerund is Verb + Noun, while that of Present Participle is Verb + Adjective.

</Text>

<Text>
Gerund = Verb + Noun (Verbal Noun)
Participle = Verb + Adjective (Verbal Adjective)

</Text>

<Text>
Its Different Forms

Tense 					Active Voice 			Passive Voice
Present or Continuous 		    Loving 			 Being loved
Perfect 				Having loved 		          Having been loved

Teaching is easy. (Gerund)
To teach is easy. (Infinitive)

<Text>Rules of the Use of Gerund</Text>

<Text> The following are the Rules of the use of</Text>

<Text>Gerund</Text>

<Text> Rule 1—Gerund and Possessive Case</Text>

<Text> The Noun or Pronoun coming before Gerund must be used in Possessive case. As—
1. I am sorry for my being late.				(not “for me / I being late”)
2. I am glad at your reaching here in time.		(not “at you reaching”)
3. Please excuse me for my coming late.		(not “me / I coming late”)
4. Nobody can prevent my going there. 			(not “me going there”)

Note—(i) If the Noun coming before Gerund is a lifeless thing, it should not be used in the
Possessive case. As— </Text>
<Text> 
1. There is a chance of the milk turning sour. (not “milk’s turning”)
2. There is danger of the roof falling in rains. (not “roof’s falling”)

(ii) In the same way, Possessive case should not be made of Plural Nouns ending in – s, or of Demonstrative Pronouns (this / that / these / those).

* Rule 2—There are some Verbs after which only Gerund should be used (not Infinitive).

These Verbs are : Feel, mind, avoid, consider, enjoy, excuse, finish, miss, can’t help, look forward, to give up, go on, it is no good, it is no use.

As—
</Text>

<Text>
  
1. I avoid going there. 				(not “avoid to go”)
2. I can’t help rejecting your application.		(not “can’t help to reject”)
3. We just missed catching the train. 		(not “missed to catch”)
4. Would you mind leaving me alone. 		(not “mind to leave”)
</Text>

<Text> Rule 3—Compound Nouns as Gerunds</Text>
<Text> 
The following compound Nouns have Verb + ing as one part of their form. This Verb + ing part is called its Gerund. As— Walking-stick, writing-table, frying-pan, hunting-whip, sitting-room, inking-pad, etc.

This is because the ‘ing’ part is not separable from the complete word, and therefore it cannot be a qualifying Adjective.
</Text>
<Text> Rule 4—Compound Gerunds</Text>

<Text> 
Sometimes Gerunds can be formed by using Past Participle form of the Verb after Having or Being. They are called Compound Gerunds.
As—
</Text>

<Text>
1. He is fond of being praised.
2. He is afraid of being punished.
3. We hear of his having won a reward.
4. He is guilty of having deceived a friend.
</Text>

<Text>
  
Rule 5—Gerunds as Ordinary Nouns
</Text>

<Text>Sometimes Gerunds can be used as pure ordinary Nouns. They have ‘The before them and ‘of’ after them.</Text>

<Text>
1. Now there remains only the signing of the treaty.
2. From here we can watch the setting of the sun.
3. Let us now begin the singing of the hymns.

<Text>Kinds of Participle</Text>


<Text>Participles are of three kinds—</Text>

<Text>
  
1. Present Participle (Verb + ‘ing’)
Eg: running, dancing, singing, crying, etc.

2. Past Participle (third form of the verb usually ending in—ed, –d, –t, –en, –n)
Eg: tired, learned, burnt, broken, hurt, etc.

3. Perfect Participle (having + Past Participle)
Eg: having done, having completed, having seen, etc.

</Text>

<Text>Active Voice 				Passive Voice
Present : loving 				Present : being loved
Perfect : having loved 				Past : loved

</Text>

<Text>Uses of the Participle</Text>

</Text>

<Text>I. Attributive Use :</Text>

<Text>1. He jumped off a running train.
2. The river has flowing water.

How to use present participles?

There are a lot of ways of using present participles. You can see some examples of present participle. Here are many present participle examples.

<Text>
Rule 1 - When two actions happen simultaneously

The present participle is used when one action is being done and another action is taking place by the same person.

For example

( 1 ) Rahul fell asleep listening to music.
( 2 ) He went into the rain running.

Where listening and running are present participle examples.

Moreover, it’s also used when one action is done very quickly after another one.

For example

( 1 ) Throwing the bag, he went to the cinema.
( 2 ) Getting off the clothes, he took a bath.
( 3 ) Seeing his mother, he touched her feet.

Where throwing, getting and seeing are present participle examples.

In these sentences ( 6, 7, 8, 9 & 10 ), both the actions are occurring at the same time or one action after another.

2. I live in the house built by you.
3. Where is the book written by you ?
